               <p>As before, building on your feedback, we'll have four videos, then some content for zoom! These are:</p>
               <ul class="summary">
                  <li>What is conservation palaeobiology? &ndash; Section 7.1.</li>
                  <li>A deep time perspective &ndash; Section 7.2.</li>
                  <li>Environmental stressors &ndash; Section 7.3.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>In person we'll cover multiple environmental stressors (Section 7.4) and Geoheritage (Section 7.5). As per, you can find videos covering those materials at the bottom of the website, provided as an alternative to the podcast if you miss the in-person session. You do not need to watch those videos unless you are unable to attend in person.</p>

            <h2>7.1 &ndash; What is conservation palaeobiology?</h2>
            <p class="justify">Some people out there make jokes about palaeontologists. We're like the drummers of the science band (I speak from experience, having been both a palaeontologist and a drummer). That is, perhaps, one reason palaeo-types love conservation palaeobiology: we &ndash; and fossils &ndash; can actually be useful. It is a new, and highghly interdisciplinary field, that is growing in importance given the significant human impacts on the majority of earth's ecosystems.
               Let's meet the field, and cover some context.</p>

                     <li>Conservation palaeobiology uses data from palaeobiology and palaeoecology (=geohistorical data) to meet adress challenges in conservation.</li>
                     <li>The fossil record is valuable because it provides big spatial and temporal scales, and endless natural experiments we can study.</li>
                     <li>When we're thinking about conservation, given that ecosystems are, and have, always changed, and thus geohistorical data can help us make nuanced decisions.</li>
                     <li>We can apply this to the relatively recent (geological) past to help us understand today's ecosystems, and deeper in time to understand underlying principles.</li>

            <h3>The absolute latest, from some of the greatest</h3>
            <p class="justify">I've referred to a number of awesome colleagues throughout this course &ndash; there are many super smart people doing really cool research across the gamut of palaeo-related topics. And conservation palaeobiology is no different.</p>
            <p class="justify">A bunch of those colleagues that work at the interface of conservation and palaeo, got together for a meeting recently, then published a series of papers related to this area. You can get these all through our library! If you think your future interests and career paths may lie in the conservation area, why not take a look? You can find the contents of this special issue by clicking on the link below:</p>

            <p>Enjoy!</p>

            <h3>The PETM</h3>
            <p class="justify">If understanding climate change is your bag, then the PETM is a really interesting and relevant topic. You can learn more about it, and the impact it had on plants, in the Palaeocast podcast linked below:</p>
            <p class="justify"><a href="https://www.palaeocast.com/episode-68-fossil-plants-and-the-paleocene-eocene-thermal-maximum/">Fossil plants and the Paleocene Eocene thermal maximum</a>.</p>

            <h3>Geoheritage</h3>
            <p class="justify">Whilst we need to conserve living communities, fossils are also important for many reasons. We need to conserve these too. Doing so is in the realm of geoheritage. This is a different field to conservation palaeobiology but this lecture felt like the correct place to include it! If you want to learn more, the best place to look is chapter five of this freely availble book:</p>

            <p class="justify">In case you have had to miss our in-person session, here are the lecture elements of that for you. <strong>If you are reading this before the in-person session, you don't need to watch this video, or the next, as we will cover them when we meet.</strong></p>
            <p class="justify">Like busses, stressors rarely come alone. But when we have multiple stressors, how do they interact with each other, and how does life interact with that combination? These are big questions, and we don't have as many answers as we would like. But the case studies in this video provide an overview of where we currently are.</p>
