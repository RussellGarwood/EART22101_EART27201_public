            <p>Palaeoecology is a diverse field. Some of it relies on clever anologies with living creatures, whilst some uses hardcore quantitative/computational techniques. There's a fair bit in between those two as well. I've done my best to create a
               narrative for you that ties this all together! I hope you enjoy it.</p>

            <p class="justify">Let's start by defining terms, and then looking examples of the ecology of individual (fossil) species: how they lived their lives, and what role they played in their ecosystem. This is the world of palaeoautoecology.</p>

                  </header>
                  <ul>
                     <li>We can split palaeoecology into two subfields &ndash; palaeoautoecology, described above, and palaeosynecology (the study of ecosystems in the past).</li>
                     <li>Palaeoautecology will often focus broadly on mode of life and life traits, through drawing inferences from the morphology of organisms (=functional morphology).</li>
                     <li>The inferences of functional morphology build on adaptations of organisms to the environment in which they live.</li>
                     <li>We can do this with fossil species by using organisms that are alive today as an analogy, or by using quntitative techniques.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In person we'll think a bit more about trilobite modes of life, digging deeper into the mode of life of a range of species, and - if you like - playing with some more 3D models. If you have a laptop, tablet or similar device, please do
                     bring it along.</p>

            <p class="justify">The thing about niches &ndash; well, a thing about niches &ndash; is that organisms can help define their niche through their behaviour. This means that there are lots of ways in which niches can be differentiated. This is

                        <li>Resource partitioning: species specialise in the resources they require (e.g. space, food) allowing them to avoid direct competition.</li>
                        <li>Predator partitioning: this relies on the differential impact of predators/pathogens that are prey/host specific.</li>
                        <li>Conditional diofferentiation: occurs when competing species differ in their ability to consume/employ a resource through varying environmental conditions.</li>
                        <li>Temporal partitioning: niches are partitioned based on timings of their activity.</li>
                        <li><em>(of course, if time leads to conditions changing, this could be a form of conditional differentiation, but if you consider time a resource, it is a form of resource partitioning!)</em></li>

            <p class="justify">As I said in the last video, I think palaeoecology, especially the computational analyses I'll be highlighting in person (or in section 5.6 below), is a fast developing and super exciting field. Here are some bonus bits if

            <p class="justify">And here is the second, crazy cool, study. Also from a gifted bunch of palaeo people!</p>

            <h3>Want to do some analysis yourself?</h3>
            <p class="justify">Computational palaeoecology is developing fast. And there's nothing like actually doing an analysis to get a feel for a field. If, like me, you like fiddling with code, you may want to give an analysis a shot.</p>

                  2020</a> student conference that was developed and then kindly released to the public by three colleagues, <a her="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/pgr/2057/bethany-allen">Bethany Allen</a>, <a href="https://amdunhill.wordpress.com/">Alex Dunhill</a> and <a href="http://www.graemetlloyd.com/">Graeme Lloyd</a> from the University of Leeds:</p>

            <p class="justify">The above link includes all the code you need (you'll need to install <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>). I've put the introductory video below, so you can watch this first if this is all of interest to you. It

            <p class="justify">As a general note, I am not just very grateful for my colleagues who made this workshop and released it for free, but am very jealous of... you! Back when I was training as a palaeontologist, resources like this were rather
               harder to come by. I think it's fair to say that fewer palaeontologists, even a decade ago, used computer-based approaches. That you can do this sort of analysis on your own PC from anywhere in the world is... just super cool!</p>
            <p class="justify">If you do try this, and get stuck, please feel free to ask for help during the zoom session or via email, and &ndash; whilst this is outside my wheelhouse &ndash; I will very happily try and help out.</p>

            <h2>5.5 &ndash; An example from the fossil record</h2>
            <p>In case you have had to miss our in-person session, here are the lecture elements of that for you. <strong>If you are reading this before the in-person session, you don't need to watch this video, or the next, as we will cover them when we
                  meet.</strong></p>
            <p>Let's have a look at the impact that this interaction of niches and gradients has on the distribution of fossil groups in rocks.
               The exact nature of this impact is defined by the environment and time period in which fossils were deposited: palaeontologists spend significant amounts of time building up expertise
               that allows them to make nuanced interpretations of fossil assemablages, that take into account (palaeo)biogeography, environmental conditions, and fossil preservation (taphonomy).
               Our next video provides a quick overview of how this all works, and can help us undesrstand the water depth in which a sediment was deposited on ancient clastic shelves: common squences of environments from beaches into the deep sea.</p>

                     <li>There are many roles fossils can play that are really useful to geologists. An important one is differentiating depositional environments.</li>
                     <li>But we do need to be aware of the biases introduced by the processes of fossilisation.</li>
                     <li>We can identify water depth in marine environments based on fossil assemblages that vary with depth, and through time.</li>
                     <li>This is true of both body, and trace fossils: but we always have to consider potential confounding factors.</li>

                  <h3>Benthic assemblages</h3>
                  <p>In this video and the lecture, I introduced biofacies and the associated benthic assemblages. The table below provides an overview of each of these benthic assemblages! It was published in the following textbook:</p>
                  <p><em>Brenchley, P.J., Brenchley, P. and Harper, D., 1998. Palaeoecology: Ecosystems, environments and evolution. CRC Press.</em></p>
                  <p>You don't need to learn this, but it might be useful to you to give them a read to get a better idea of the differences between these assemblages.</p>

                     <h3>Summary</h3>
                  </header>
                  <ul class="summary">
                     <li>There are a number of biases that we need to be aware of: we shouldn't just assume that number of fossils species is strongly related to the true biodiversity at the time those fossils were deposited.</li>
                     <li>Using large databases, we can correct for biases.</li>
                     <li>As an example, doing so for marine environments suggests that biodiversity does not continually increase to the present (it may rather reflect the prevalence of reef ecosystems).</li>
                     <li>We can also use these approaches to understand how species respond to changes in climate.</li>
                     <li>In the latest Carboniferous, aridification reduced diversity, but increased cosmopolitanism (i.e. species became more widespread).</li>
                     <li>These insights help us understand the impact that current environmental changes might have.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <!--<h3>Associated task</h3>
                        <p>None! I've kept the associated tasks light this week because in the bonus stuff section, I've linked a workshop that gives you an opportunity to actually do one of these analyses! Its very exciting and cool! So if you want to dig down deeper into today's topics (and get some experience of coding) please do invest some of your free study time giving this a shot.</p>-->
