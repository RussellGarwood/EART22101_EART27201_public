            <p>The main topic of this lecture is macroevolution. What is this? Well in order to dig into that, I wanted to quickly get us on the same page with a couple of terms I'll be using a lot. These are:</p>
            <div class="container medium">
               <ul class="summary">
                  <li>Interspecific: existing or occurring between different species.</li>

               </ul>
            </div>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Macroevolution is probably best defined a evolution that occurs through sorting of interspecific variation.</li>
                     <li>This is a useful concept assuming processes (e.g. fitness, competition and selection) differ within and between species.</li>
                     <li>The red queen hypothesis emphasises biotic processes, over abiotic ones (=the court jester), as drivers in evolution.</li>
                     <li>By calibrating the rate of molecular evolution with fossil ages, we can estimate clade divergence times, and thus evolutionary rates.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="justify"><strong>Note: </strong>The version of this video where I explained molecular clocks more fully ran on far too long. But, fear not, if you want to learn more, I've put a link in the bonus stuff section to an article I wrote that explains it in a (hopefully) understandable way.</p>

                     <li>For example, these suggest that the Cambrian explosion may have been a short period of elevated rates of evolution.</li>
                     <li>The idea that evolution is gradual and consistent (phyletic gradualism) held sway for a long time.</li>
                     <li>An alternative &ndash; that evolution happens in bursts with stasis in between (punctuated equilibrium) &ndash; is quite hard to test.</li>
                     <li>It seems likely that different environments lend themselves to different variation in rates.</li>

            <h3>In which Russell does his best to explain molecular clocks</h3>
            <p class="justify">As I mentioned above, I didn't the time to explain clocks in the detail I would ideally like &ndash; there's too much exciting science to cover, and not enough time. But I have written an explanation of how Bayesian approaches to phylogeny work, in their basic form, that you can find here:</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2018/deducing-the-tree-of-life/">Garwood, R.J. 2020. Patterns in Palaeontology — Deducing the tree of life. Palaeontology [online] 8(12):1-10.</a></p>
            <p class="justify">If you want to know more about how they work in terms of clocks, then give me a shout, and I will happily explain!</p>
            <p><br /></p>
            <h3>Is adaptedness the same as fitness?</h3>
            <p class="justify">I asked you above, whether you thought that being highly adapted (showing high levels of adaptedness) was the same as fitness. I think this is a really interesting question (hence me asking).</p>
            <p class="justify">In brief, within a given environment an adaptation &ndash; to that environment &ndash; does make an organism fitter. But being highly adapted does not always mean you will have a higher fitness. For example, think about the example I have used previously of the avocado with its giant seed. This adapted to being distributed by a megafauna that is now extinct.
               While being highly adapted, because that fauna has now gone extinct, the avocado is no longer particularly fit &ndash; there is nothing out there left to spread its seeds. This is one example of how these two things can become decoupled.
