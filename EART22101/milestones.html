            <p>Abiogenesis is the technical word for the origin of life. We believe this happened on Earth (as opposed to another planet &ndash; this was an idea that held sway in the 1970s, but is not considered as likely today). Abiogenesis probably happened before 3,800 million years ago: exactly when, how, and what happened next, are the contents of this part of the course.</p>

               </header>
               <p>We're going to cover:</p>
               <ul class="summary">
                  <li>The origins of life and abiogenesis &ndash; Section 1.1 - 1.2.</li>
                  <li>Early evolution, archaea and bacteria &ndash; Section 1.3.</li>
                  <li>The great oxygenation event &ndash; Section 1.4.</li>
                  <li>The origin of eukaryotes &amp; sexual reproduction &ndash; section 1.5.</li>
                  <li>The origins of multicellularity, ediacaran organisms, and animal origins &ndash; in-person session (but see below for video versions).</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Last year, these last parts were delivered in videos (as you will have noticed from the above), but this year we'll be finishing them off in person! This slight change reflects both the changes in the COVID situation between last year and this, and also the feedback from last year's course.</p>
               <p>Throughout these materials: Ga = 1000 million years, Ma = 1 million years.</p>

               <p>Following on from the last question, before our in-person session, you might like to think about whether you consider a virus to be alive or not, as we will discuss it in our first session. This is in part semantic, but it also digs down into what we really mean by life. I've provided a link to further reading in the bonus material which isn't obligatory, but is worth checking out if you are interested in this topic.</p>

            <h2>1.2 &ndash; Abiogenesis!</h2>
            <p>
               Another key thing to consider in abiogenesis is where the materials came from that are required for life as we know it. In this video we look at the source of these materials, and then how abiogenesis itself may have ocurred.

                        <li>Prebiotic soup theories &ndash; largely cold and oceanic, informational molecules early.</li>
                        <li>Metabolits theories &ndash; hot and associated with deep sea vents, metabolism before informational molecules.</li>

                  <p>Multicellularity is hard to define &ndash; but a rough working definition for our needs is multiple cells forming an individual and those cells specialising to different functions. We can say:</p>
                  <ul class="summary">
                     <li>That multicellularity is seen throughout the eukaryote tree of life.</li>
                     <li>It originates in the majority of these instances through symbiosis of organisms of the same species to form a colony.</li>
                     <li>The earliest definitive evidence of cellular differentiation, and sexual reproduction, is found in <em>Bangiomorpha pubescenes</em> &ndash; a 1.2 Ga red algae.</li>
                     <li>Ediacaran organisms, that appear at 635 Ma are the first macroscopic, multicellular organisms to be widespread in the fossil record. Where they sit on the tree of life is challenging to deduce.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <!--<h3>Associated task</h3>
                  <p>How do you think the Ediacaran Fauna may have gotten their energy? What form of life did they lead?</p>
                  <p><em>We will discuss at the synchronous session - spend about ten minutes thinking about an answer.</em></p>-->

            <h3>Quiz results!</h3>
            <p>First, I figured that you may be interested in the result of the question at the end of the last quiz! The question was, are viruses living? The response, so far, is shown below.</p>

            <p>If you would like to explore this question a little more <a href="https://microbiologysociety.org/resource_library/knowledge-search/are-viruses-alive-what-is-life.html">this article from the Microbiology Society</a> is a good place to start, and has some links to further reading at the end. One thing is clear what has happened over the last six months: dead or alive, understanding viral evolution and viruses is integral to keeping societies safe, economies running, and countries'
               borders open.</p>

            <h3>The absolute latest in Ediacaran Palaeobiology</h3>
            <p>I've placed a video below of a talk by my hugely talented colleague <a href="https://oumnh.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-frankie-dunn">Dr Frankie Dunn</a>, given as part of a lecture series by the <a href="https://oumnh.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Museum of Natural History</a> (all of which are well worth your time!). As well as introducing the very latst research on frond-like Ediacaran species, it will also stand you in good stead for the forthcoming lectures on evolutionary relationships.</p>

            <p>If you like this, and found it useful, there are more talks in this series that are highly relevant! You can find these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/oumnhvideos/videos">here</a>. That by Professor Paul Smith titled <em>The Cambrian Explosion and the evolutionary origin of animals</em> gives an insight into the Cambrian explosion, and the video <em>The First Animals: When, Where and How?</em> digs down further into this question.</p>
