            <p>Welcome to this website covering evolution! These videos are aimed at first year undergraduates (they were written for a first-semester workshop), and will be particularly useful to those who have not studied biology recently.</p>
            <p>We focus on the basics of evolution &ndash; split over five sections. Click on the button below to start with an introductory video.</p>

            <p>The theory of evolution underpins the life sciences, but also impacts many areas of the physical sciences. These videos introduce some key concepts for you. As it currently stands, I have not added any quizzes to this webpage, but I intend to revisit this in future.</p>

               <h3>The answer?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>When you have had a chance to think about this, expand the item below for some background regarding the domestication of dogs &ndash; which is pretty much what we're looking at, even though I didn't explicitly use the word domestication!</p>

            <details>
               <summary>Whence dogs?</summary>
               <p>The key process at play here is something called artificial selection, a process humans facilitate through selective breeding. Here is a definition for you:</p>

               <div class="container small">
                  <blockquote>The practice of selecting animals for breeding on the basis of phenotypic characteristics such as their appearance, performance, or production records. This is common in breeding dogs (Caninae) for showing, horses (Equidae) for racing, and farm animals for milk or meat production. <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191761577.001.0001/acref-9780191761577-e-339?rskey=Vv8ASP&result=2">Source</a></blockquote><br />
               </div>

               <p>Using this process allows humans to control phenotypic development. To domesticate dogs, you might chose to select for:</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Tameness (i.e. breed those individuals which are least afraid of humans)</li>
                  <li>Smaller size</li>
                  <li>Other physical traits such as smaller jaws, diminished craniofacial development</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Here is what we actually know of this:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves began between 40,000–20,000 years ago</li>
                  <li>Thre are competing theories to how domestication may have occurred</li>
                  <ul style="margin-top: 2%; margin-left: 10%; list-style-type: circle;">
                     <li>Humans may have captured wolf pups for use in guarding or hunting, resulting in selection for traits of importance for these new roles</li>
                     <li>Alternatively, as humans changed from a nomadic to sedentary lifestyle during the dawn of the agricultural revolution, wolves may themselves have been attracted to dumps near early human settlements to scavenge</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>This is quite an active area of research, and new ideas are coming out all the time. (And of course, some of this assumes you believe Chihuahuas are tame &ndash; I understand some people believe they're not that chill).</li>
               </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
               <summary>Bonus info: Domestication syndrome</summary>
               <p>More broadly, looking at domesticated animals, we can identify a suite of behavioral, physiological, and morphological traits that are associated with domestication. This is referred to as domestication syndrome.</p>
               <p>It includes (but is not limited to) docility and tameness, changes in coat colour, reduced tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, and alterations in the form of ears and tails form. In addition to these morphological traits, it is also associated with changes to the reproductive cycles and hormones of the animals, shifts in the concentration of a number of neurotransmitters, a longer period of juvenile behavior, and reductions in total brain size, and also of specific brain regions.</p>
               <p>Recent research suggests that these may all be linked, and current work is exploring the mechanisms that might underlie this &ndash; these could, for example, be developmental.</p>
               <p>If you want to read more, this paper is a good place to start: Wilkins, A.S., Wrangham, R.W. and Fitch, W.T., 2014. The “domestication syndrome” in mammals: a unified explanation based on neural crest cell behavior and genetics. Genetics, 197(3), pp.795-808.</p>
            </details>
            <p><br />So there you have it &ndash; now you know a bit more about the origins of dogs... Including Misse and Turlu.</p>

            <p class="justify">We've now covered the basic of evolution. Let's put it into practice. With a quiz! Below you can see something cool &ndash; an ant (left), and a spider (right). What's going on?</p>

            <p class="justify">In its simplest terms, they look alike &ndash; and the fact they do is a result of evolution. What we are seeing here is a form of mimicry (this form is actually Batesian mimicry if you're interested). The spiders resemble ants in great detail - both in terms of their morphology (see the narrow "waist", for example), and in terms of behaviour &ndash; they wave anterior appendages to look like antennae and walk in a distinctive zig-zag way. In spiders such as this, research suggests that the <i>selective pressure</i> driving this mimicry is the fact that predators such as spider wasps and other, larger, jumping spiders.</p>
            <p class="justify">In case you're wondering just how deep this rabbit hole goes, there is some evidence that appearing like an ant can also help these spiders prey on others which are ant averse, and there is even a species
