            <p>Hello there, and welcome to this chunk of course content, which focusses on the molluscs. Molluscs are a diverse group of really cool animals, and in this series of videos we're going to meet the three most common groups that we come across as fossils.

            <h2>Introduction and biology</h2>
            <p>
               The molluscs have deep roots &mdash; they have Precambrian origins, had a diversity of weird forms in the Cambrian, and there are a number of groups that have survived from early in the Palaeozoic through to today.
               Other groups <em>were</em> very successful, but have now gone extinct. So we'll start here with a quick overview of the biology of the group, their evolutionary history, and when their diversity through geological time.

                  <li>Molluscs form a diverse group of Lophotrochozoa that includes slugs, snails, squid, cuttlefish, octopuses, ammonoids and all manner of marine shellfish such as clams, mussels, and oysters.</li>

This will be useful, because in the next video we're going to be learning the terms for the different bits and how they relate to each other.

            <h3>Cephalopoda</h3>
            <p>Cephalopods include squid, octopodes (or octopuses &ndash; choose your poison, but not octopi which is a latin pluralisation of a greek word...), cuttlefish, ammonoids, and also a group called belemnites. More on this in the next video.</p>

            <h3>Gastropoda</h3>
            <p>You can normally identify a gastropod by its coiled shell - although not all members of the group have a shell. Gastropods include snails, conches, periwinkles, limpets and whelks. Plus slugs. Cool, huh?</p>

            <h3>Bivalvia</h3>
            <p>Bivalves can be easily identified from their shells - whilst there are two in life, often you only find one as a fossil! The group includes clams, mussels, and oysters.</p>

                     <li>Belemnites are often found as bullet-shaped fossils. They are actually closely related to squid and octopodes.</li>
                     <li>Gastropods have a twist in their body, and also a spiral shell.</li>
                     <li>Bivalves are common as fossils, and their hinges, and traces of the mantle/muscle attachements, are very valuable in taxonomy within the group.</li>

               It's important to be able to communicate with other palaeontologists/geologists about fossils, so you'll need to be at least familiar with some of these phrases.

            <p><em>Gymnotoceras beachi</em>, which you met above, is actually a ceratite, if you want to contrast it with these two!</p>

            <h3>Bivalvia</h3>
            <p>Bivalves are often found not with two shells, as shown above, but as a single shell - as you can see here. In particular the inside surface provides lots of clues to their taxonomy. We are not covering this in depth here, but if you ever work with these, you'll get to know the inside of their shells really well.</p>

               <p>Key points to take away from this video are:</p>
               <ul class="summary">
                  <li>The cephalopods tend to survive fairly well as fossils, as do gastropods.</li>
                  <li>Bivalves are often fragmented, and found concentrated into layers.</li>
                  <li>Bivalves are useful for telling us the way up of a rock, and also its environment of deposition.</li>
                  <li>Ammonites, in contrast, are really excellent index fossils. This is because they are:</li>

                     <li>Rapidly evolving.</li>
                     <li>Easy to identify.</li>
                     <li>Have a wide geographic distribution.</li>
                     <li>Facies independent.</li>
                     <li>Common (their fossils have a high abundance).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>These are key attributes for any really good index fossil in biostratigraphy!</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If you would like to get a bit more experience at seeing molluscs in thin section, have a play with the virutal microscope below! This, courtesy of <a href="https://www.virtualmicroscope.org/content/limestone-purbeck-marble">the UK Virtual Microscope and the Open University</a> is a thin section of a famous building stone: the Purbeck (called a Marble in the building industry, actually a Limestone). These rocks are found in Dorset, and are chock full of whole, and fragmented,
                  gastropod shells, embedded in a micrite. There are even some geopetal structures in there - see if you can find one.</p>
