            <h1>Welcome to EART27201 - Microfossils</h1>
            <p>Greetings and salutations! This website introduces microfossils. These fossils are really important - and really useful in numerous fields. This website acts as a whistlestop tour of the world of microfossils, before pointing to places you can learn more about them. We'll learn what a microfossil is, how we can extract and study them, and meet some of the major groups.</p>

            <p>What is a microfossil? Why are they useful? How do we extract them from the rock, and then how do we study them? The answer to all these questions can be found in out first video. So strap in and hit play.</p>

            <h2>Siliceous Microfossils</h2>
            <p>For our remaining videos, we're going to have a quick trip through the wonderful world of microfossil groups. These are organised by the composition of their hard parts. This is a useful way to categorise microfossils for our purposes, as it dictates how we extract and study them. With that, let's meet our first group of microfossils &ndash; those which make their hard bits out of silica (silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

            <h3>A bonus model</h3>
            <p>In general, the groups in this video are so diverse, that I don't think there is much utility of me lining 3D models up for you to check out. Indeed, both plants and vertebrate bones look pretty much like you would expect them to do as fossils. So there aren't many surprises here.</p>
            <p>But I did want to throw in one more model for you, which is a plant fossil typical of the Carboniferous coal measures, and one you stand a good chance of finding if you ever to fieldwork in northern England or Wales. It is called <em> Lepidodendron</em>, and represents the stem of an extinct lycopod (clubmoss) with leaf pads on it:</p>

            <h2>Lets meet some siliceous microfossils</h2>
            <p class="justify">I'm afraid the majority of these microfossils are so small that creating 3D models from the fossils themselves is really challenging. As such we're going to have to go with digitally sculpted 3D models (as opposed to ones created using the actual object), or photos taken down a microscope, rather than 3D models. But hopefully it'll be enough to give ou an idea of what they look like.</p>
            <p class="justify"><strong>Note:</strong> I also have had to use a variety of sources for the 3D models on this page. The creator (and thus copyright holder) is shown in the top left of each, and you can visit the source by clicking on the logo bottom left. It also means that these links are more likely to break than my normal ones. If this has happened, I'd apprecite it if you could let me know via email.</p>

            <p>Diatoms are a form of algae with a silica sekeleton, you will recall from the video. Remember that diatoms were split into two groups. A single frustule of a centric diatom &ndash; the kind typical of marine envitronments &ndash is shown below.</p>

            <p>Next up, we have microfossils whose hard parts are made of phosphatic materials. Often such fossils are the remnants of vertebrates. The only group we're going to meet in depth is one such example, and comprise small calcium carbonate fluorapatite, or francolite, fossils (this form of apatatie has the the formula (Ca,Mg,Sr,Na)<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>,SO<sub>4</sub>,CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>F<sub>2-3</sub>).</p>
