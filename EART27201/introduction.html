            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This part of the course focusses on fossils - both micro and macro (small and big).</p>

               As Russell mentioned on blackboard, these websites from 2020 are provided to help you study and revise. You do not need to watch them in advance of any given session. They integrate the practical and lecture elements into a single session.
               You'll then find Blackboard quizzes to help you test your knowledge.

            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Most videos will have something to do after them. But given the last video was largely information for you, in this instance we're going to move right along, and start looking at some of the biology you'll need to understand for everything else to make sense.</p>
            <p>We'll be covering the following, important, terms:</p>

            <p>After watching the video, I suggest you revisit this lot and make sure you have them down. If it helps, you may want to make a list of them and include your own definitions. The other vocabulary in the video we'll revisit later, but you don't necessarily need to remember it all.</p>

            <p>The study of how fossils are preserved is taphonomy. In our last video we delve into this a little, looking at what happens between death and fossilisation, and spend a little time looking at different qualities and types of preservation.

                  <li>Organisms make their hard parts from a variety of materials, and the hard parts have many different uses.</li>
                  <li>There are a great many process that might occur to the remains of an organism between death and fossilisation. These include:</li>
                  <ul style="margin-top: 2%; margin-left: 10%; list-style-type: circle;">
                     <li>Decay</li>

                     <li>Flattening</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>There exist sites notable for their fossils (Lagerstätten) which can be concentration, or conservation Lagerstätten.</li>
                  <li>The latter are sites of exceptional preservation: these provide key insights into past life.</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>Aragonite v.s. calcite</h3>
               <p>Rhodri has already covered this in his carbonates course. But, a key thing to note, which will crop up a few times over the coming weeks, is that there are two forms of calcium carbonate that are common in the animal kingdom CaCO<sub>3</sub> - calcite and aragonite. Furthermore, calcite comes in two flavours in animal world &ndash; high magnesium calcite, and low Mg calcite.</p>
               <p>These differ in terms of their crystal structure, and also in terms of their stability. A result of the latter is that, over geological time under the majority of pressure and temperature conditions, aragonite recrystalises to calcite.</p>
               <p>This is here, just so you know it is the case! If you want to learn more (there are lots of implications surrounding changes in sea water chemistry and the evolution of animals), the following paper provides an overview:</p>

            <h2>Types of preservation</h2>
            <p>In case you're wondering how fossils and practicals are going to work for this course: we have a digital solution. You will get to see lots of really amazing fossils. It is a palaentology course after all. Throughout, I'll be providing you with plentiful fossils to look at, in the form of 3D models you can load in your browser.</p>
            <p>Below you should be able to find 3D models of fossils, representing the different kinds of preservation we may see as geologists. Clicking on it will load a 3D model, and then you can click and drag to rotate it. Give it a shot!</p>

      <div class="content dark style3">
         <div class="container">
            <h3>Unaltered fossils</h3>
            <p>Sometimes the hard parts of an organism are found in rocks unaltered. We can thus find the original materials (often biomineralised, but sometimes tissues) the organism created in life. Below are some examples in the form of shells.</p>
            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Mollusk" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/04bd8f55740342429cbf34ca9a5b9792/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">This is a mollusk - a gastropod, called <em>Ecphora quadricostata</em>. It's upper Pliocene in age, and from the Yorktown Formation, Hampton County, Virginia. This shell is made of calcite, and is 37.7 mm in length.</p>

            <p>Depending on your computer you may be able to load multiple models at once. To stop any browser issues, though, I recommend closing each when you have finished looking at it. Hit the cross in the top right to do this.</p>

            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Mollusk" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/ae909c439e2c42d9a8cce8196513ec9d/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">This is a bivalve mollusk (a scallop, in fact : <em>Argopecten gibbus</em>). It is Pliocene in age, and comes from Sarasota County, Florida. Both this, and the above, are from the collections of the Paleontological Research Institution, Ithaca, New York. Specimen width ~6 cm.</p>

            <h3>Permineralization</h3>
            <p>When the pore spaces in a porous material get filled with minerals this is called permineralization. This is common in - for example - bone and wood. Common minerals include calcite or silica, and are often sourced from groundwater. The original non-pore space may remain unaltered, or itself be replaced with minerals. A famous example of this form of preservation is found in the form of petrified wood, where the pore space is filled with minerals, and the wood is later replaced - thus no original wood is left. Check out the example below!</p>
            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Petrified wood" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/bff8909bb3ca44ada16fa0628818ab65/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">Petrified (= permineralized) wood. Cretaceous in age, and sourced from Seymour Island, Antarctica (!) - antartica was a lot warmer in the Cretaceous. Longest dimension ~9 cm.</p>

            <h3>Carbonized fossils</h3>
            <p>This kind of fossil occurs when organisms were buried quickly, and most often when there was little oxygen around. The remains of the organism are two-dimensional carbon films found on bedding planes. They often look black, because they are so carbon rich. The famous Burgess Shale, which you learned about last year, comprises carbonised fossils, but also this is relatively common in plant fossils, especially from the Carboniferous!</p>
            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Graptolites" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/c3a9395dbb0f439a800449cda2945e08/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">These are fossil graptolites - we'll be learning about this group later in the course (species <em>Monograptus clintonensis</em> if you're interested). They are Silurian in age, and were found in the Williamson Shale, Rochester, New York. Maximum dimension of rock ~11.5 cm. </p>

            <h3>Replacement</h3>
            <p>Cool beans. Aren't these fossils nice? Let's look at replacement next - this happens when the original materials in a fossil are replaced with some form of secondary material - often shortly after burial. In this example, pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) has replaced calcite: this is a pyritized fossil.</p>
            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Brachiopod" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/091de1e5940144d9a5222ea29a37a303/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">A pyritized brachiopod (<em>Paraspirifer bownockeri</em>), Middle Devonian in age and sourced from the Silica Formation of Ohio. Longest dimension ~4.5 cm. Check out that gold coating this is the pyrite.</p>

            <h3>External moulds</h3>
            <p>As I mentioned in the lecture, sometimes a fossil can dissolve. The impression it leaves is a mould. Similarly, when you split a rock, on one part you will have the fossil, but you will find a mould on the other bit of rock you split off. If this mould represents the form of the outside, it is an external mould. These are relatively common within concretions - growths of a mineral around a fossil which harden, prior to its complete decay, leaving a void and a mould. A couple of super cool examples are shown below.</p>
            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Ammonite mould" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/dc28706b4aeb42da87e3c136a646206e/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">This external mould records the shape of an ammonoid in the genus <em>Gunnarites</em>. It's Cretaceous in age, and was found in the Lopez de Bertodano Formation, Snow Hill Island, Antarctica. Diameter of mould ~9 cm. In this case you can also see - if you want to - <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cephalopod-gunnarites-sp-pri-61543-aa818d5b7bc54fe288f81aa72156b816">the shell that formed this mold</a>.</p>
            <p>And here's another lovely example, from the Echinodermata:</p>
            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Crinoids" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/162d24c3075f41d38615375456dab048/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">Now, this is a good age. Here we have the Devonian crinoid <em>Melocrinus williamsi</em> (Ithaca Formation, Cortland County, New York). Here you can see both the unaltered mineralized hard parts, and external molds of bits no lost. The whole rock is ~29cm long.</p>

            <h3>Internal moulds</h3>
            <p>Just sometimes, we get internal moulds. This occurs when, for example, an organism dies, and rots, but its shell was filled with sediment, or a mineral. If, then, the shell eventually dissolves - but what filled it does not - we are left with an internal mould! Sometimes, if you're lucky, you can find an external mould to go with the internal one.</p>
            <div class="video">
               <iframe title="Gastropod" width="1280" height="720" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/4a7559f7b4b34e758d15e02656a64112/embed?ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1&amp;ui_stop=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; vr" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="caption">In this gastropod, lucky you, you can see both internal and external moulds! They are labelled for you. This species is called <em>Cassidaria mirabilis</em> and it's another Cretaceous fossil from Snow Hill Island, Antarctica. Gastropod ~6 long.</p>

            <h3>Casts</h3>
            <p>If an external mold (or gap between and internal and external one) is filled with a substance that then lithifies, what you have is a cast. Cool huh? This reproduces the original form of the structure. So a mould is formed off an original structure, and a cast when a mould is filled. </p>

            <p class="caption">This is a really famous example of a cast - a fossilised tree stump from Fossil Grove, an ancient forest in Glasgow’s Victoria Park (this model is copyright of Historic Environment Scotland; it's around waist height).
               It is Carboniferous in age, and was formed after an influx of sediment buried the lower parts of trees. That became sandstone, and then the void left when the tree rotted away was filled with sand as well, forming a natural sandstone cast.
