    This is a bit out of date - this no longer uses units - but is a useful guide. In this site, for example:
                <div class="col-6 col-12-narrow">
                    <div class="row">
    This is based on a 12 unit grid - thus above is two columns on wide screens, but collapses to one on narrow ones.

            <h2>Introduction and biology</h2>
            <p>Trilobites were a very successful fossil group during the Palaeozoic Era. They appear in the fossil record at about 521 million years ago, and ultimately went extinct at 252 million years ago having struggled since the Devonian.</p>
            <p>We'll start by looking at the biology of the trilobites, what other animals they are related to, and when they lived.</p>

               That was pretty cool, right? Do you think you spotted everything? In particular, one of the harder features to make out was the facial suture. If you didn't spot it, perhaps go and load the first model again and see if you can. If you want a pointer - or to check you're correct - expand the item below.
